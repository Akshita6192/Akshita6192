Talent Analytics (Data Scientists in SG)

Data science is the hottest job in the market globally. Harvard Business Review called it the **"sexiest job of the 21st Century"** in 2012. According to the numbers, they were right.

This project is purely based on my curiousity to learn what kind of Data Science Talent is available in Singapore. Probably the best platform to acquire such data is LinkedIn. Most recruiters connect with Data science professionals through LinkedIn, and it is also a very strong platform for any organizaton's hiring needs.

I have experience of working in the Technology recruitment business, and I have observed the demand for solid data professionals increase year on year. The increasing demand is still not being met by the talent supply available locally. Most firms struggle to find the right talent and I want to do a deep dive on this field of employment. 

**This analysis will be valuable for two main audiences** : 

1. Aspirants looking forward to starting/exploring a career within Data Science space 
2. Recruiters and potential hiring managers who want to hire the right talent for their firms and teams respectively. 

**Meanwhile Singapore plans to become Asia's Big Data Hub**  https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/news-and-events/insights/talent/how-singapore-plans-to-become-asias-big-data-hub-in-2018.html
